// here 'class' is the keyword represtnting that it is a class declaration
//name of a class in Java will start with upper case
//give unique names to your Java class, never give Java, main or method,class, package
// we will write our java program inside the class

// step 1 : write a program    -- editor - eclipse
// step 2: compile the program- it is converting our program into a machine understandable language  -- it is done automatically, compiled by itself
//step 3: run the program and provide the results -- .java file will be generated
// you will provide the instuctions(java language) to perform an action and get the output
